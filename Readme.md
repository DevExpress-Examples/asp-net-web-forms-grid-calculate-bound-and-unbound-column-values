# How to sum values of bound and unbound columns and calculate a total value on the client side


<p>This example shows how to sum values in two columns. One of them is bound to a data source column. The other one contains ASPxSpinEditor fields, in which any numeric value can be typed. Results are shown in the 'Total' column. Also, in the footer of this column, the total sum of all its values is displayed.<br> All calculations are performed on the client side. Calculated values aren't stored in the data source.
